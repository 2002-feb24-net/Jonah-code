    Desktop apps: 

    Web: ASP.NET, 

Mono
    uses C#

.NET Core (came around in 2016)
    Software that can compile and run C# (the code platform)
    Uses C#
    restructuring of .NET Framework, meant to be a way to work across platforms easily
    abs: EF Core

    Desktop apps: WIN Forms, WPF
    
    Web: ASP.NET Core

SDK

After making changes to a repository:
(record the changes in git, locally)
    git add <path> (path is a "." when referencing current folder)
    git commit -m "description of changes"
(push the changes to the remote github)
    git push

Git for Windows
    gave windows users ability to use bash
    It's a distributed version control sysytem for tracking source code during development 
    Git itself is useful for storing code repositories and working in a team environment
    Should know all about 'clone', 'pull', 'status', 'add', 'commit' 'push', etc commands

Bash
    It's a command line environment (Bourne Again SHell)
    relative path - starts from the directory you are currently in
    absolute path - is the entire path up to the directory you are in or the directory you are wanting to go to
    Know these commands: pwd (prints absolute path), cd, .., mkdir, rm, mv, cp (copies a file or folder), grep (searches for a string instance and prints the line to console), 
        which (gives the path location of the file you specify), find (searches for files and directories), echo (outputs strings that are passed to it as args), touch (creates a file), 
        | (allows the output of what's on the left of it to be input for what's on the right), cat (prints content of a file)
    PATH ???
    ~  is shorthand for the current user's home folder
    . is the current directory
    .. is the current directory's parent folder

VS Code
    it's the code editor (IDE)
